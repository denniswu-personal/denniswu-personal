                      <p>I'm a hardware engineer at Google working on camera systems, image processing, and image quality. Graduated from Stanford in March, 2017 with a maters degree in Electrical Engineering, I developed great passion in prototyping and building products. You can find my complete resume in the link below. <br />  <br /> 
                        Not only do I work with cameras, it's also my one of my greatest interest. Photography has long been there with me as I traveled across the world. You can see some of my selected works <a href="/photography/">here</a><br />  <br /> 
                        Born and raised in Taiwan, I'm the first in my family to cross the Pacific. Exploring the world as much as I can is my ultimate goal. Feel free to make comments and leave a message.
